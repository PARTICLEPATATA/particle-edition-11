            <br>
            <hr>
            <p>Alright, I’ve thought it over and there isn’t much I can do. Technically speaking, I’m only one person
                (Am I a person? Do people have health bars?), and I have no weapons, help, or experience in close range
                combat. I would have no hope against an enemy if they did leave that room. I’d get beaten up to the
                point there I couldn’t move- I’m straying off again, aren’t I? <br><br>
                Honestly, none of this explains my decision to help the creature escape from behind the door. This is
                just a gut feeling I can’t seem to go against. Perhaps I’m just lonely and having someone (or something)
                else could be beneficial. Anyway, despite all the signs saying I’d lose a fight, that’s only in the
                possibility that I’ll have to battle for my life. What if the creature behind the door is here to help
                me? There’s no surety, but what can I say? I’m willing to take the chance. <br><br>
                I start in the direction of the rooms, with slow steps. Mentally, I’ve made my decision, but something’s
                still slowing me down and asking me to rethink everything. I can’t tell what is, but I’m not going to
                let it stop me. I speed up my steps, and stop right outside the door the noise seems to be coming from.
                Ah… it’s much quieter now. Can this thing sense my presence or something?
                <br><br> It takes me a second to realise everything’s changed. In the place where five rooms stood in a
                U formation with one at the centre and two on either side, the shape has shifted to some kind of
                irregular shape. Where five uniform, bright red painted doors stood, there are now multicoloured glass
                doors that seem impossible to see through. How? The whole infrastructure of this side of the house has
                shifted completely… is that even supposed to be possible? <br><br>
                Ah, I sometimes forget I’m not in my world anymore. This is some paranormal, magical, house of little
                horrors, isn’t it? <br><br>
                I should just give up on trying to understand what’s happening. The door I’m standing in front of has
                large blobs of different colours covering its surface, but mostly twisted purple ones that fade into
                black, with a dull matte black door handle with a single keyhole for a skeleton key. I wonder what that
                means. Does purple have some sort of symbolic meaning? I close my eyes, and take a deep breath, and try
                to focus on what’s behind the door. Whatever loud noise was coming has slowed to calm scraping at the
                door; much like a dog would do, waiting for its human to come home from outdoors. Maybe it’s a little
                pet to keep me company here? That would be nice. Somehow, I don’t think it is. I don’t know, maybe
                another gut feeling. There’s been too many of those today already, I’m sick of it. <br><br>
                I’m not sure how exactly to help bring the door down. Do I try to kick it down or something? Oh,
                something’s glowing over my head again. I tilt my neck and strain upwards to see what the words read
                now. Everything’s the same, except the words ‘POWERUPS: ALL EQUIPPED” shifts to a bright yellow
                ‘POWERUPS: SUPER STRENGTH’. Whoa, is this because I thought about kicking the door down, and now I have
                super strength to do that? That’s so cool! <br><br>
                With my newfound energy, I attempt to knock down the door by kicking it. Though it shudders from the
                force I used, it doesn’t leave even the smallest of cracks in the glass. Seriously, did these guys
                manufacture bulletproof glass for this? Ah, well then. Brute force isn’t the way. What else do we have?
                <br><br>
                Oh. The key. <br><br>
                I whip the key out from my pocket, the same old one, and jam it into the door’s keyhole and jerk around
                hastily. This has to work, right? <br><br>
                I don’t even notice that the sound stopped entirely after my first attack on the door. <br><br>
                The door miraculously opens, and swings inward with force. I just freeze for a second, and realise how
                dumb my idea really was. What did I just do? What if there’s a monster waiting somewhere to kill me? I’m
                too lost in questions to realise there’s nothing behind the door, but I see it opens up into a much
                larger room than the one I had woken up in. I walk in and pull my arms around myself, the only form of
                protection I have right now. <br><br>
                I turn a corner, and I hear someone yelling right into my ear. Wait, what? A person? I yell right back
                in surprise, until both of us look at each other then stop to catch our breath. The person in front of
                me is a good three inches taller than me, and she’s decked out in some ancient-looking Nordic armour
                studded with pale yellow gemstones, that covers her from neck down till her toes, leaving nowhere for
                her to possibly gain an injury in battle. Her voluminous blonde hair stretches from her head all the way
                to her elbows, and with her bright blue eyes and incredible facial structure, she might be the most
                gorgeous person I’ve ever seen. <br><br>
                “Who- who are you? What’s your name?’ I ask slowly and carefully, so as to not potentially anger her.
                She looks powerful enough to end me with no effort at all.
                <br><br>
                I never get to hear her voice. Instead, a bubble pops up over her head with something written inside of
                it. <br><br>
                ‘im xXPhoenixX, who ru?’ <br><br>
                xXPhoenixX? I can’t tell if that’s an exotic new name or just plain strange. What are people even naming
                their kids these days? <br><br>
                Another bubble popped up. ‘whats ur name?’ <br><br>
                It takes me a second to realise I have absolutely no idea what my name is. The realisation strikes like
                a brick wall, but I have no time to even think it over. A huge white box pops up in front of me before I
                can think of anything. <br><br>
                “Enter Username: ____________” <br><br>

                Since Joy and the other gods lost the battle, there has not been peace anywhere in the world. Evil rules
                through her tyranny. Without the king of the gods, the world is plunged into chaos. Confidence serves as
                the enforcer of rules made by Evil, whipping those who mutiny and rebel. She makes those who disobey her
                rules starve and go mad by hunger and thirst. Moral has been named the acting king of the gods. But
                there are not many gods to be king of. Most of them have mutinied and gone over to the dark side,
                serving the queen, Evil. Only Moral’s wife and son stay with him to support him. The world as we knew it
                has perished. Perhaps, someday, another hero, or even the same one, will restore peace and tranquillity
                to the world.

            <h1>Why trumpets are one of the coolest instruments in an Orchestra</h1>

            <h3>By Aadhav</h3>
            <br><br>
            <div id="highlight">
                <img src="quote.png" style="width:50px;">
                <br>
                <p id="highlight_p"><strong>Mutes are the coolest part of a trumpet. There are 3 kings of mutes the “straight”, “cup” and the “wow wow”. </strong></p>
            </div>
            <br><br>
            <p>
                Although they come in different sizes and lenghts, trumpets are a key instrument to any classical
                orchestra. For example take Shostakovitch’s Overture in A major, which starts with several trumpets;
                booming in harmony. This is just one of the several pieces where a trumpet is the leading instrument in
                the orchestra. <br><br> Trumpets sounds are produced by a mouthpiece; without which the trumpet would
                just be a big brass tube. This mouthpiece has a shallow cup shaped opening against which the players
                must adjust the air pressure and shape of the lips to adjust the note. The overall pitch of the
                instrument can be altered by turning a slide, which changes the length of the instrument. <br><br> After
                playing for a while the sound can become gurgly because the player’s breath condenses into the trumpet
                forming drops of saliva. Disgusting isnt it! But all the player needs to do is to is press a water key
                which allows the saliva to drip out. <br><br> The bell of the trumpet basically acts as an amplifier and
                produces the full tone we expect to hear from the trumpet. However this can be changed using mutes
                <br><br> Mutes are the coolest part of a trumpet. There are 3 kings of mutes the “straight”, “cup” and
                the “wow wow”. The wow wow mute is often used in jazz performances because it produces a funny wow wow
                sound during their performances. <br><br> To further understand trumpets better please listen to like
                mentioned above Shostakovitch’s Overture in A major and Haydn’s Concerto for the trumpet in E flat.
                <br><br> Thank you for reading this and I hope you enjoyed it.

            <div id="highlight">
                <img src="quote.png" style="width:50px;">
                <br>
                <p id="highlight_p"><strong>Once in a while I wonder if there’s still an insect corpse in my lung from the time I inhaled a mosquito.</strong></p>
            </div>
            <br><br>
            <p>
                Mayflies are weird- like they only live 24 hours and that makes me wonder- is their perception of time
                different from ours or are they really the gods of yolo? <br><br>
                Mosquitoes are really annoying, like
                when you’re almost asleep and a mosquito starts buzzing right next to your ear and when they suck your
                blood and transmit diseases- One time when I was in 5th grade I accidentally inhaled a mosquito and
                every once in a while I wonder if there’s still an insect corpse in my lung- sometimes I really wonder
                if their existence is important to the world. <br><br>
                I feel like I have a love hate relationship with
                autocorrect- on one side it helps the errors I make when I type on my phone because I’m trash at phone
                typing but then it also corrects the spelling mistakes which were meant to be there- so I turned off
                autocorrect- it’s not that bad actually. <br><br>
                It’s been one week since I tried fixing my sleep
                schedule and I got 7 hours but I’m more sleepy if not sleepier than what I was <br><br>
                I write a brief
                of my thoughts for 3am brain factory on my notes app because it’s easier to start my laptop or write it
                down on paper because it’s dark at night and when I mean brief I mean 3 or 4 words- So I wrote ‘apple
                juice phone racist’ all as a sentence and I have no idea what 3am me meant by that- <br><br>
                Personally
                I don’t believe in superstitions and I’m fine with people believing in them as long as they don’t force
                me to agree with it too- But I do have to wonder, is believing in the ‘black cats are bad luck’ one
                being racist but towards cats- and one of my friends asked “what if a cat’s grey, or half black and half
                white, does it mean it’s half bad luck half good luck”. Come to think of it most of these are based off
                of conversations I’ve had with people- <br><br>
                What’s a monogram- <br><br>
                If today is today and
                tonight is tonight then why is yesterday night not yesternight- English is weird <br><br> Phones are
                dumb <br><br> I wrote that out of spite because I couldn’t type and my phone kept falling on my face
                phones aren’t dumb- and I hate when my phone falls on my face- <br><br> That’s all I have for this
                edition see you in edition 12

            <p> Let's suppose you need to measure out exactly 4 liters of water.
                <br><br>
                But, of course, you have a problem. You have two containers each 3 and 5 liters in volume respectively. 
                <br><br>
                Each container has no other marking except for the fact that it only provides its known volume. Using a running tap to fill them how would you measure out exactly 4 liters?

<br><br>
“Adam.“ Said Leo. “How- How did you know we would be moved across the maze when I threw the weed?”
<br><br>

“I think the maze thought we were marking our path, and shifted us elsewhere like previously. Also, ouch. I’m bleeding. Do you have anything which could help?”
<br><br>

“Hmm... let me examine our wounds.”
<br><br>

After some time, he handed Amber and I a vial of something which he told us to apply on our wounds. He told us that we were infected with poison (the name was too long to remember) and that applying what he gave us would heal it.
<br><br>

WHOOOPS! There’s a catch! Why wouldn’t there be one? Did you expect medicine to have no side effects? HAHAHAHAHAHAHA. You were wrong.
<br><br>

The antidote stopped the burning sensation immediately, but guess what? Now, the world kept spinning around, and everything got blurry.
<br><br>

Then I puked. Yes, the side effect was both nausea and dizziness. Very handy for fighting monsters, right?
<br><br>

“Leo, what is going o- “was the last thing I said before I blacked out. 
<br><br>

“Adam- Adam, are you okay?”
<br><br>

Everything was blurry. I tried to wake up, but I couldn’t.
<br><br>

“Adam! Wake up! “
<br><br>
“ADAM!”
